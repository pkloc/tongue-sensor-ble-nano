Create new project in platformio choosing Redbear BLE Nano as the board and Arduino as platform.

Your platformio.ini should contain:
  [env:redBearLabBLENano]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  framework = arduino
  board = redBearLabBLENano
  lib_deps = BLEPeripheral
  build_flags = -DNRF51_S110

Main source file should include:
  #include <Arduino.h>
  #include <SPI.h>
  #include <BLEPeripheral.h>

The MK20 board must be flashed with firmware before it can be used to program the BLE Nano. Follow instructions at the following URL:
  https://github.com/redbear/nRF5x/tree/master/USB-IF

In Windows, install the USB CDC driver.
